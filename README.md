# Hello-World
My first Repository
I am a telecoms engineer and technical manager

Many years ago at South Devon Technical college I learned to use machine code, I have since had many technical roles at major blue chip telecom, media and finance businesses working on their telecoms and IT equipment but none have required programming, although I have worked very closely with database programmers developing applications, trained data entry operatives, conducted business analysis and process & data QA. I have a teen daughter very interested in modding games and building apps and her dad has a consultancy formalising and consolidating management systems for blue chips in the insurance industry. I hope to learn skills that will help me teach my daughter new skills and hopefully take on some roles within the consultancy.
